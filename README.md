# Mini-Social-Platform
A mini social media platform to improve my Java/Spring Boot/React

## Project Description
This project aims to implement a mini social media platform that allows friends and family to connect to each other, similar to Facebook. This project is also to help me practice my fullstack development and to help me continue my Spring learning.

### Tools Used:
1. Visual Studio Code
2. IntelliJ IDEA
3. Github

# Development Logs

### Phase 1
For the first phase, I plan to use my past experiences to quickly implement user functionality, testing, security, and a frontend. The following list summarizes the phase 1 planned features:
- Users can create, login to, and logout of their accounts.
- Users can login with JWT web tokens, with passwords encrypted in the database.
- Users can view and change their profile information, including username, profile pictures, and descriptions.
- Users can view the page hosted online.
- Developers can test the main services through an automated test suite.
